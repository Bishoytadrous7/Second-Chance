# 🛍️ Second Chance – Used Items Web App

**Second Chance** is a full-stack web app that allows users to list, discover, and interact with used items being sold or shared by others. Users can post items with photos or videos, browse listings by category, upvote and comment on posts, and customize how they view the content. Authentication ensures users must log in to comment or like, and their usernames are displayed to others.
